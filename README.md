# poly.hs
This Haskell script converts any denary integer into a polyonomial where `x` is a specified base.

For example:

```
poly 10 42069
>>> p(x = 10) = 4x^4 + 2x^3 + 6x + 9

poly 2 23
>>> p(x = 2) = x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
```

I was motivated to create this after learning about this way of representing place value from one of my university lectures. It is quite cool indeed.
